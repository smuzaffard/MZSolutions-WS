MZ Solutions — Website bundle
-----------------------------
Contents:
- index.html : single-page website with animations (Tailwind, GSAP, Lottie)
- assets/img/favicon.svg : favicon

How to deploy:
1. Unzip the archive or upload the folder to your host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or cPanel).
2. Point your domain mzsolutions.in to the host (update DNS A/ALIAS/CNAME as required).
3. Enable HTTPS (Let's Encrypt or host-managed SSL).
4. For the contact form: replace the demo handler with your backend endpoint or use services like Formspree / Netlify Forms.

Notes:
- Lottie loads animation JSON from lottiefiles CDN. Replace with a local JSON file for offline hosting if needed.
- Replace placeholder images with real project screenshots and your logo for best impact.
